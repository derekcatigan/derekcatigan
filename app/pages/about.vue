        During my internship at Business Machine Technologies Inc. (Bizmatech)
        in Mandaue City, Cebu, I worked as a Software Developer, contributing
        primarily to backend features for internal systems used to manage
        marketing data such as customer invoices, product information, and
        related business records.

        During my academic years, I also participated in the Eastern Visayas
        Regional Pitching Competition for the Philippine Startup Challenge 8,
        conducted by the Department of Information and Communications Technology
        (DICT) Region VIII on October 10, 2023, where our team pitched a
        platform designed to help blue-collar workers connect with job
        opportunities.

        After graduating, I worked remotely as a part-time Junior Software
        Developer at Pinoy Pride Worldwide LLC, a Filipino-American company,
        where I rebuilt and modernized their legacy website and system—improving
        usability, design, and scalability for a logistics platform handling
        balikbayan box services for Filipinos and returning residents.
